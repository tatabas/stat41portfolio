# stat41portfolio

This is a short overview of some of the products I created in my Statistics and Data Visualizations class. 
The HTML file is embeded on my website: https://sites.google.com/view/tolga-atabas/r-portfolio. The interactive charts and shiny app can be tested 
on this site. 

Overall, I have created skills in multivariate data visualization ranging from plots of points, lines, and bars to geographic and/or heatmaps.
All of these skills were paired with data analysis, data cleaning and statistics.

The RMD file has the code used for making the visualizations. The HTML file is a demo, live on my website. The csv file is used for the project and 
comes from the Delphi group at CMU.
